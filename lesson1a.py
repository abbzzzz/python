# What is a variable: Variables are labels which act as containers to hold values. In python a variable is always associated with some values
# We use the assignment operator (=) to assign values to a variable.
# Anything that is inside quotes in python is called a string
message = "Hello there! Hope everything is fine"
print(message)

message2 = "Good bye"
print(message2)


# concatenating variable (joining tow or more variables of an output together)

message3 = message + message2

print(message3)

#variables can be named using a letter, number and an underscore_ They can start with a letter and an underscore but not with a number
_name1= "Brenda"
print(_name1)

#variable names cannot contain spaces. We can use the underscore to separate the names

#variable names are not supposed to be keywords or reserved xters in python
